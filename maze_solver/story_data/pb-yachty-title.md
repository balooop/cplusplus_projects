*Some wacky, bright jazz music plays. Retro, neon block lettering falls on the screen. It reads "Space Jam 2"*

Yes, I broke the fourth wall. You see a menu pop onto the screen, with three options: play, extras, and exit.

# pb-yachty-play
You choose to start space jam.

# pb-yachty-extras
You feel risky. You choose to start off by watching the extras.

# pb-yachty-exit
You hate space jam. Lebron sucks. This story sucks. You choose to exit.
