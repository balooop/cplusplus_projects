The gang arrives at the super cool space basketball courts, the Monstars were waiting eagerly for their challengers. 

"Look at them," Derrick exclaimed "they're wearing the jerseys of the players they robbed of their talents".

Sure enough, the four man Monstar lineup was set - Evan Turner, Joe Ingles, Reggie Bullock, and Luke Kennard. 

Anticlimactically, the game was a breeze. It was probably going to be this way, anyway; they had Derrick Rose and Lauri Markannen. 
The gang handidly beat the Monstars, 126 - 34, with Lauri and Derrick combining for 124, and Lil Yachty accidentally scoring a basket that was meant to be a lobbed pass. Lebron James didn't play the game, citing his desire to "manage his load," learning from superior players.

The monstars gave back their stolen basketball powers, and Lil Yachty went to sleep peacefully on his Lil' Boat.
