* fade to movie, Lil Yachty and Lebron James are eagerly training *

"Man this magic training juice you've got is CRAZY, it feels like we've only been playing for a few minutes!" Yachty says, stopping the shootaround for a minute

"Well, it's been 32 days, Boat, and you finally are hitting 25% of your threes - maybe we'll have a chance against the Monstars after all!" Lebron announces.

The boys have been training hard for weeks now. The Monstars have been talking mad trash on Twitter - using the stolen powers of the legendary Evan Turner, of course. Having sucked up the powers of all the big NBA stars, they look poised to win. However, they forgot two key players, still with their powers in tact; how they forgot is a true mystery, these are the two greatest players of all time: Lauri Markkanen and Derrick Rose.

"Oh look, here they come" Lebron notions to the car bursting through the doors to the basketball court. Derrick rose jumps through the car's roof, basketball in hand, and performs a 720 through the legs double clutch layup, and then proceeds to land with all of his weight on his left big toe. Lauri proceedes to throw a basketball through the newly-minted hole in the car, and drains the basket. Nothing but net. 

"So what, are we gonna practice some more or play this ball game!" Derrick asks.

Lebron James is a boring, robotic, human being. He opts to practice more before the game - it is what Xi Jinping has asked of him.
