The air was calm and cool, the sky dark as night. Out in the middle of the ocean, nothing was to be heard. The boat, albeit small, was luxurious - champagne poured from a life-sized statue of the owner; a full-sized basketball court adorned the floor of the starboard side; and disco-lights lit up the indoor area as "Broccoli" blared through the ship-wide speaker system. It was, of course, the S.S. Lil', owned by none other than Lil' Boat himself. Miles Parks McCollum, otherwise known as Lil' Yachty, awoke on a roof. Ever the seafarer, McCollum was no stranger to waking up in on his own Lil' Boat after a night of lavish partying. But this was different: the air was far less thick than usual, and he had no idea how he ended up here. He had to get to the bottom of this - either by himself, or by calling for help.
