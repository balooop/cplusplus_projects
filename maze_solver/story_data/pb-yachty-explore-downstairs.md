Downstairs, a light flickered on. A man in wearing a bright yellow and purple suit sat behind a steel desk, facing a wall. Yachty noted how far back his hairline was.
"Wait a minute" McCollum thought "I ain't got a desk down here".

"Who are you?!" Yachty exclaimed "What's happening to my boat"

Slowly, the man turned his chair around.

"Good evening, Mr. Boat" the man said. He stood up. Suddenly, a figure ran out from under his foot. "Was that Magic Johnson?" Yachty thought.

The realization dawned on him none other than Lebron James had kidnapped him on his own boat. 

"Lebron James! I won't sign with the Lakers man don't you already have AD?" 

"No, Boat, I don't want you to help me win a ring - I only need two other superstars to do that, not three. The stakes here are much higher. Basketball itself is at the risk of dying" James explained.

"What do you mean?" Yachty asked. "Is this some Space Jam 2 type beat?"

"Yeah lol it's exactly that," Lebron responded. "Roll the title sequence"
