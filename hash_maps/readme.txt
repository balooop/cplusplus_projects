This project implemented hash tables with three collision handling methods. Open hashing (separate chaining), and closed hashing (linear probing and double hashing) were the two meta-categories of hash map implemented. The files edited were dphashtable.cpp, lphashtable.cpp, and schashtable.cpp.
Functions implemented:
    Separate chaining
    1) insert(): inserts a given key and value pair into the hash table utilizing the appropriate collison handling method.
    2) findIndex(): returns the index of the input key.
    3) remove(): removes a key from the hash table
    4) resizeTable(): resizes the hash table based on a load factor of 0.7 
    Linear Probing
    1) insert(): inserts a given key and value pair into the hash table utilizing the appropriate collison handling method.
    2) findIndex(): returns the index of the input key.
    3) remove(): removes a key from the hash table
    4) resizeTable(): resizes the hash table based on a load factor of 0.7 
    Double Hashing
    1) insert(): inserts a given key and value pair into the hash table utilizing the appropriate collison handling method.
    2) findIndex(): returns the index of the input key.
    3) remove(): removes a key from the hash table
