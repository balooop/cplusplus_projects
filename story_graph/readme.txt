This project implemented a graph using an adjacency list as a part of a course-wide, large scale story. I essentially created a "choose your own adventure" text story, and utilized graphs to implement the story's branching choices.
Functions implemented:
    1) degree(): returns the degree of a vertex in a graph
    2) insertVertex(): inserts the vertex in the graph and in the adjacency list
    3) removeVertex(): removes a vertex in a graph and from the adjacency list
    4) insertEdge(): inserts an edge in the graph and at the adjacencylist
    5) removeEdge(): removes an edge from the graph using either two vertexes connected to the edge, or an iterator in the edge list
    6) incidentEdge(): gets alle dges incident to the vertex as a vector
    7) isAdjacent(): checks if two vertices have an edge between them
    8) shortestPath()utilizes a BFS to find the shortest path between two paths in a graph
