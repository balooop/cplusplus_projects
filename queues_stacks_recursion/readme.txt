This project involved implementing a variety of exercizes with queues, stacks, and recursion.
The files I implemented for this project were excersizes.h, excersizes.cpp, quackfun.h, and quackfun.cpp
The first recursive exercize was to sum the digits of a number using recursion.
The second recursive exercize was to sum the number of blocks in a triangle with "n" rows, where each row had "n" blocks in it.
The queue and stack excersizes were as follows:
    1) Use a queue to check if parenthesis, squiggly braces, and square braces are "matched" within an input string containing any characters.
    2) Use a queue to "scramble" elements in a queue. Starting at n = 1, n elements are left in order, n is incremented, and the next n elements are reversed.
    3) Verify that a queue and stack contain the same values in the same order.
This project was a lab assignment for CS225, and all materials outside of those mentioned were provided by course staff.
