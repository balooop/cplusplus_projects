This project implements an image rotation function and creates a creative art piece that is a color gradient. The files I contributed to were intro.cpp, intro.h, main.cpp, HSLAPixel.h, HSLAPixel.cpp, and the Makefile.
Functions implemented:
    1) Makefile: this file compiles multiple files into a single executable
    2) rotate(): reads an input image, rotates it 180 degrees, and writes it back to an output file
    3) myArt(): generates an image that creates a repeating rainbow gradient
The HSLAPixel class was implemented to represent pixels in a PNG in the HSL color space.
This project was completed for CS225. All materials not mentioned were provided by course staff.
