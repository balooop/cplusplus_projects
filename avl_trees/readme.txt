This project implements a self-balancing AVL tree. I contributed to avltree.h and avltree.cpp.
The functions implemented were:
    1) rotateLeft(), rotateRight(), and rotateRightLeft(): these performed standard node rotations used to rebalance AVL trees.
    2) rebalance(): this function re-balances a tree at an input node
    3) insert(): this function adds a node to the AVL tree at its proper location using recursion and then ensures that the tree remains balanced.
This project was completed for CS225. All materials not mentioned were provided by course staff.
