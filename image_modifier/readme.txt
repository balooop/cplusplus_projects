This project involved creating the HSLAPixel class and lab_intro.cpp, which included functions that modified images.
Implementing the HSLAPixel class involved writing the .h and c.pp files. The class is used to represent each pixel within a PNG.
The lab_intro class invovled implementing functions that modified input images to perform one of four modifications to it: 
    1) Illinify transforms each pixel to an Illini Orange or Blue color
    2) Spotlight puts a spotlight around a designated center point inputted to the functions
    3) Grayscale transforms the image into a grayscale version of itself
    4) Watermark puts a watermark on the main input PNG
This project was an assignment for CS225, and the PNG class and main file were provided to us
