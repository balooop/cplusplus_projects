This project models network flow through graphs. It also constructs residual graphs to assist in keeping track of the flow. The files I contributed to were NetworkFlow.cpp and NetworkFlow.h
Functions implemented:
    1) constructor: inserts all vertices and edges into residual and flow graphs
    2) pathCapacity(): calculates the path capacity of a given path
    3) calculateFlow(): calculates the capacity of a path in the residual graph and updates the max flow, residual, and flow graphs
This project was completed for CS225. All materials not mentioned were provided by course staff.
