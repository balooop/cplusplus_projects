This program applies machine learning techniques to a graph to play the state-based game of Nim efficiently. The files I contributed to were nimlearner.h and nimlearner.cpp. More about the game of Nim can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim
Functions implemented:
    1) constructor: creates the graph of edges and vertices for Nim.
    2) playRandomGame(): implements reinforcement learning by randomly playing nim games, updating graph edge weights to represent winning and losing decisions.
    3) updateEdgeWeights(): updates edge weights along a path on the graph
